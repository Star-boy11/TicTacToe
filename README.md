# TicTacToe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic pen-and-paper game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your symbols (usually X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this project, we will create a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML Structure:

Create a <div> container for the game board.
Inside the container, create nine <div> elements as individual cells for the grid.
Add an event handler to each cell to handle the user's clicks.
CSS Styling:

Apply styling to the game board container and individual cells using CSS.
Use flexbox or grid layout to arrange the cells in a 3x3 grid.
JavaScript Logic:

Create a JavaScript file and link it to the HTML document.
Define variables to store the game state, such as the current player and the board state.
Attach event listeners to each cell to handle the user's clicks.
Implement the logic to handle a user's move:
Update the board state with the current player's symbol.
Check for a win condition (three in a row) or a draw condition (all cells filled).
Switch the current player after each move.
Display the result (win, draw, or continue) to the user.
Add a reset button to restart the game by resetting the board and game state variables.
Overall, the project involves creating the HTML structure, styling the game board using CSS, and implementing the game logic using JavaScript. The JavaScript code will handle the user's moves, track the game state, and determine the winner. The HTML and CSS will provide the visual representation and user interface for the Tic Tac Toe game.
